        <p>Jacques Le Goff was born on 1 January 1924. He was a French historian and prolific author specializing in the Middle Ages, particularly the 12th and 13th centuries.</p>
        <p>A prolific medievalist of international renown, Le Goff was sometimes considered the principal heir and continuator of the movement known as Annales School (École des Annales), founded by his intellectual mentor Marc Bloch. Le Goff succeeded Fernand Braudel in 1972 at the head of the École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS) and was succeeded by François Furet in 1977. Along with Pierre Nora, he was one of the leading figures of New History (Nouvelle histoire) in the 1970s.</p>
        <p>When Pour un autre Moyen Âge was first published in 1977, medievalist Jacques Le Goff had already done much to change the way we view the Middle Ages. Le Goff, dubbed 'the Pope of the Middle Ages' by the press and affectionately known as the 'gourmand historian' by his colleagues, is one of the most important representatives and pioneers of the 'New History', in which the emphasis in historical research has shifted from political figures and events to the history of mentality and historical anthropology. To put it in simple terms: what was life like for 'the common man'?</p>
        <p>
This shift in perspective has led not only to studies on countless new subjects (such as the significance of the visual imagination), but also to new ways of looking at old ones. One of Le Goff's great insights is that the 11th- to 13th-century Church was a totalitarian institution that successfully gave society meaning and direction by introducing the concept of Purgatory. Knightly discipline and the use of sermons and powerful visual images to disseminate the Church's message among the masses made it possible for mere mortals to achieve the Christian ideal, provided they followed the Church's teachings.</p>
        <p>
Le Goff is a prolific writer who has published works on politics, intellectualism, economics and the human body as well as a number of biographies. In addition to a life of St. Francis of Assisi, he has written a tome about Saint Louis that is more than a biography; it is a minute reconstruction of the mythologising of the French king and the exploitation of that myth. Le Goff has been an astonishingly creative writer for more than four decades, precisely because he connects new insights to established historical tradition.</p>
        <p>In October 2000 he received an Honorary Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Pavia. He was also nominated Accademician of Studium, Accademia di Casale e del Monferrato, Italy.
In 2004, he received the Dr. A.H. Heineken Prize for History from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
