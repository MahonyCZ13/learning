1. Install Python

2. If after you install it python still isn't recognized then in PowerShell enter this:

   [ENVIRONMENT]::SETENVIRONMENTVARIABLE("PATH", "$ENV:PATH;C:\PYTHON27", "USER")

3. Close PowerShell and then start it again to make sure Python now runs. If it doesn't, restart may be required.

4. Type quit() and press Enter to exit python.

5. Now you can use 'python' keyword to run pyton scripts from every working directory
